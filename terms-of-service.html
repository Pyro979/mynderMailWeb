        <h2>Terms of Service for mynderMail</h2>

        <h3>Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>
            By downloading, installing, or using mynderMail (“the App”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”).
            If you do not agree, do not use the App.
        </p>

        <h3>Description of Service</h3>
        <p>
            mynderMail is a mobile application that allows you to quickly send emails to yourself—or other configured recipients—using your Google Account and the Gmail API.
            The App is designed for convenience and personal productivity, not for emergency communication or mission-critical use.
        </p>

        <h3>User Accounts</h3>
        <p><strong>Google Account:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must have a valid Google Account to use the App.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google Account.</li>
            <li>You are responsible for all activity conducted using your Google Account.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for unauthorized access to your Google Account caused by factors outside our control.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Account Access (OAuth):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App uses Google OAuth to authenticate your account.</li>
            <li>You grant the App permission to <strong>send emails on your behalf</strong>.</li>
            <li>The App does <strong>not</strong> read your email, access your inbox, or view your contacts.</li>
            <li>You may revoke this permission at any time in your Google Account settings.</li>
            <li>Revoking access prevents the App from sending emails.</li>
        </ul>
